#Boston Public Health Commission Android Mobile App

Created by Boston University's Global App Initiative Club

Basic framework here, alowing for a "forum" Q&A-type mobile application, with the goal of eventually allowing medical professionals to answer and curate responses to anonymous questions about STD preventative information!

Also allows retrieval of relevant Tweets about the Boston Public Health Commission into a "timeline" feature.

Screenshots can be found in the /screenshots folder. (All designs displayed in these screenshots were specified/requested by the Boston Public Health Commission's correspondents.)
